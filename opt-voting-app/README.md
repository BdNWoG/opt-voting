# Optimism Voting Mechanism Dashboard

A simulation framework for analyzing different voting mechanisms and their vulnerability to various attack vectors in the context of Optimism's Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF).

Maintainers: Billy Gao and Jay Yu

## Overview

This project implements a voting simulation system that models different voting algorithms and their responses to potential attack scenarios. The simulation helps evaluate the effectiveness and security of various voting mechanisms for Optimism's RPGF program.

## Features

- Multiple voting algorithm implementations:
  - Single Selection (Max Voting)
  - Quadratic Voting (with and without collusion attacks)
  - Mean Voting (with and without epsilon attacks)
- Configurable simulation parameters
- Support for custom preference matrices via CSV import
- Automated random preference matrix generation
- Interactive visualization of voting outcomes

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Technology Stack

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Usage

1. Choose a voting mechanism (Single Selection, Quadratic, or Mean)
2. Configure simulation parameters
3. Either import a custom preference matrix or generate a random one
4. Run the simulation to visualize outcomes
5. Analyze the results under different attack scenarios
